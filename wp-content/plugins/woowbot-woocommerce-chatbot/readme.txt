<strong>Onsite Retargeting, Exit Intent</strong>

Recover up to 25% of Abandoning Visitors with Onsite Retargeting. WoowBot detects exiting Visitors and displays a targeted offer to your visitor determined by you. Up to 25% of retargeted visitors will respond to your message and turn into customers. Targeted offers can be a coupon code, free ebook etc.
In-Chat Support and Contact

The Onsite Retargeting helps your Conversion rate optimization by showing special offers and coupons on Exit Intent, time interval or page scroll-down inside the ChatBot window. Track Customer Conversions with statistics to find out if shoppers are abandoning carts without completing orders. Get more sales!

<strong>Reduce Shopping Cart Abandonment</strong>
In addition to exit intent and remarketing offers, WoowBot can remind users to complete the checkout process when shoppers have products in the cart but they are not completing the order for some reason. Many shoppers add products to the cart but leave the site from other pages, after continuing to browse, before or after they reached the cart page. 

If a user leaves the site and later comes back – WoowBot will remind the shopper with a custom message to complete the order!

All of these will translate into a much higher rate of customer conversion by reducing the potentials for Abandoned Cart.

<strong>In-Chat Support and Contact</strong>
